# Go EditorJS

This package is designed to give you an 
interface between the open source editorjs
project and Golang. If you're serving data
between editorjs and a web server in Go,
this package will simplify that interaction.

## Inspiration

This package was inspired by other open
source technology. A handful of functions
were inspired and a majority were developed
by yours truly to support the apario-reader
and apario-writer applications.
